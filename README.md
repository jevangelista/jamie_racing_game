Week 1 Project - Racing game

This is a simple two player racing game incorporating the concepts we've learned in class this past week. It uses a combination of functions, loops, conditionals, class-based CSS rules and JQuery. 

**Instructions:** 
To move Player One, press down on "1", and to move Player Two, press down on "2". First player that reaches the finish line wins. Press the reset button in order to reset the game.
